 CHANGING_WORLD_NAME:0 "Changing World"
 CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "Disillusioned with a world broken by economic crises and political upheaval, Kylaris has lurched to the extremes. To the east, the Gaullican Empire has embraced National Functionalism; seeking to bring order to an increasingly chaotic world. To the west, the old Marolevic Empire has fallen, a Collectivist state rising in its place. Central Euclea squirms under the boot of both. The Federation and Negara reel from their recent civil wars, and the nations of the worlds both old and new brace for impact. Everything is about to change..."
 WER_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "In its brief sixty-year lifetime, Werania has risen to challenge the traditional Great Powers of Euclea, especially its closest rivals in Estmere and Gaullica. With such young nationhood however, national unity - amongst republicans and monarchists, the Ruttish minority and Weranic majority, Gaullican appeasers and warhawks - is fragile. To meet its newfound place in the sun, Werania must decide whether to stomach and alliance with one its oldest rivals, or to forge a new path for itself in this chaotic world. Only time will tell which route Leopold IV will take."
 FOA_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "With the Asterian Civil War having only ended thirteen years prior, and a large portion of the east still recovering, the Federation is struggling to bounce back from the Great Collapse. Liberal President Benjamin Sutton is nearing the end of his term, and his promises to rebuild the Asterian economy and mend the scars of the Civil War have fallen flat. 25% of Asterians remain out of work, and the economy shows no sign of recovery. As the situation worsens, radicals rise. The Land of Opportunity is in a slump that many believe it will not recover from."
 EST_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "Since emerging from the fires of civil war, Estmere has reasserted itself as a global power. Forging their ‘New Empire’, the Estmerish have promoted liberalism throughout the world. However, political upheaval and the Great Collapse have threatened Estmere and it’s liberal order. The rise of functionalism in the old foe has startled many, leading the government to chart a new path in Euclean and global politics that could cause more harm than good."
 GAL_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "Albert III's abdication has changed more than who wears the crown in the Montecardé family. Now Emperor, Albert IV has appointed the political firebrand Rafael Duclerque to the position of Prime Minister, bringing his Parti Populaire into government. The Giant of Euclea now finds itself fast recovering from the woes of the Great Collapse. Exemplified by functionalism, militarism and religion, Gaullican national pride has risen once more, and the economy has entered a period of growth. Yet the old enemies remain, and so long as they stand, the Last Daughter of Solaria can never truly be safe."
 ETR_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "'Avanti Uomini Liberi!' Has been the cry of Etruria since the revolution of 1917 that overthrew the decadent monarchy and established the great republic. For the past decade the republic has know great prosperity and growing power, securing itself as one of the Great Four, but behind the joy lies mustering forces. Radical populists long thought defeated during the revolution agitate and national populists speak of a patriotic revolution, while in colonies anti-Etrurian sentiments are fast moving toward rebellion. With war approaching will the republic unite and survive the tumult, or will it fall to radicalism?"
 NEG_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "One country! Emerging from the chaos of the last century with a fighting spirit, revolutionaries have torn out the heart of the old order, enforcing modernisation of schooling, infrastructure, and the armed forces across the country at a blistering pace for the past few years. Beset by foes on all sides, it aspires to secure itself as the true power of eastern Coius; at the expense of the northern imperialists or otherwise. All true Coians will rally to our banner! Violence of action is the order of the day; the time to strike for freedom is now!"

 OTHER_CHANGING_WORLD_DESC:0 "As the Great Powers lurch towards a Great War befitting their stature, the other nations of the world quake in their boots. Still recovering from the devastation of the Great Collapse, many find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yet, perhaps the Great Powers of old have had time aplenty in the light of Solaris? Perhaps it is time for a new power to rise to challenge them?"
 POWDER_KEG_NAME:0 "Powder Keg"
 POWDER_KEG_DESC:0 "Negara has made known its intention to reclaim Euclea's treaty ports. Estmere, seeking to safeguard its interests, makes with Negara a secret pact. To constrict Gaullican power in Euclea, they enter a new Grand Alliance with Werania and Etruria. Gaullica, increasingly surrounded, has negotiated its own alliance with a host of smaller nations and the Berseri Empire. Alliance networks this widespread pose a liability; whenever it is that the whole world comes to blows, and it will come to blows, the spark shall ignite the world's powder keg."
